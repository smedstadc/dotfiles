# .dotfiles
I heard the cool kids were putting their dotfiles on GitHub.

0. clone into to ~/.dotfiles
0. run `setup` to create symlinks (or `setup --force` to clobber existing stuff)
0. remember to add `source ~/.zsh_aliases` to `~/.zshrc` dummy
0. remember to add `source ~/.zsh_env` to `~/.zshrc` dummy
